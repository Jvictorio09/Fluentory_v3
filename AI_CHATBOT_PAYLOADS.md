## 7. Data Flow

### Training Flow
1. Admin uploads/pastes transcript → Frontend
2. Frontend sends transcript to `/api/lessons/{id}/train-chatbot/` → Django Backend
3. Django Backend sends enriched payload to Training Webhook → External Service
4. External Service trains AI and returns webhook ID → Django Backend
5. Django Backend stores webhook ID and updates lesson status → Database
6. Frontend receives success response and reloads page

### Chat Flow
1. User types question → Frontend
2. Frontend sends message to `/api/lessons/{id}/chatbot/` → Django Backend
3. Django Backend validates access and enriches payload → Django Backend
4. Django Backend sends enriched payload to Chatbot Webhook → External Service
5. External Service processes question and returns AI response → Django Backend
6. Django Backend returns response to frontend → Frontend
7. Frontend displays AI response to user

---

## 8. Notes

- All timestamps are in UTC
- All text fields should be UTF-8 encoded
- Maximum transcript length: No hard limit, but very large transcripts may timeout
- Maximum message length: Recommended 2000 characters
- Rate limiting: Check with webhook provider for rate limits
